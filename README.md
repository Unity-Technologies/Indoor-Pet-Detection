This project provides scripts necessary to train a model for dog detection in an
indoor home environment, with Unity generated Synthetic Data, and evaluate your model. For this example,
we will use synthetic data to train our model and real data from COCO and OIDSv6 to
fine tune and test our model.

We also show how we can upload our own custom assets, and change randomizer parameters
to change the data as required. Unity Computer Vision Datasets(UCVD) is the cloud platform
used for generating large scale datasets.

We are currently building the product out and would love your feedback - [Survey](Link).
